## Research questions

1. How doe educational sorting impact individuals' subjective well-being, independent of their own and their partner's education?
2. How do these associations vary across societies and normative climates in Europe?

## Literature review

Three propositions

- Homogamy advantage ([[@beckerSelectionAlignmentTheir2010]]; [[@keizerAreEqualsHappier2015]]; [[@stutzerDoesMarriageMake2006]])
- Status attainment ([[@zhaoPartnersEducationalPairings2022]])
- Gender roles ([[@courtenayConstructionsMasculinityTheir2000]]; [[@kaukinenStatusCompatibilityPhysical2004]]; [[@kowalewskaFemalebreadwinnerWellbeingPenalty2023]]; [[@hajduIntraCoupleIncomeDistribution2018]]; [[@potarcaAreWomenHypogamous2022]]; [[@theunisHisHerEducation2018]])

Country clusters ([[@esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990]]; [[@esping-andersenWelfareRegimesSocial2015]]; [[@ferreraSouthernModelWelfare1996]])

- Nordic countries
- Southern Europe
- Continental Europe
- Anglo-Saxon countries
- Baltic states
- Central & Eastern Europe

The normative climate

- The institutionalization of marriage (or a type of arrangement) ([[@cherlinDeinstitutionalizationAmericanMarriage2004]])
- Social disapproval ([[@kalmijnCountryDifferencesEffects2010]]; [[@keizerAreEqualsHappier2015]]; [[@soonsMarriageMoreCohabitation2009]])
- Selection ([[@potarcaAreWomenHypogamous2022]])

## Hypotheses

*Hypothesis 1:* Compared to homogamy, heterogamy is negatively associated with individuals' subjective well-being.

*Hypothesis 2:* Compared to homogamy, individuals' subjective well-being is positively associated with partnering upwards in education and negatively related to partnering downwards.

*Hypothesis 3a:* Compared to homogamy, hypogamy is negatively associated with individuals' subjective well-being, with the adverse impact being more pronounced for women.

*Hypothesis 3b:* Compared to homogamy, hypergamy is positively associated with men's subjective well-being but negatively related to women's.

*Hypothesis 4a:* A certain type of educational sorting yields greater positive influence (or exerts less negative influence) on individuals' subjective well-being in contexts (country-period units) where it is more normative.

*Hypothesis 4b:* A certain type of educational sorting yields greater positive influence (or exerts less negative influence) on individuals' subjective well-being in contexts (country-period units) where it is less normative.

## Data and methods

The European Social Survey (Rounds 1-10)

A sample of 180.733 respondents from 29 European countries

Diagonal mobility model ([[@sobelDiagonalMobilityModels1981]])

## Results

Pooled analyses

- Hypergamy was the least optimal configuration for both geneders.
- Men were more satisfied with life in hypogamy.

Contextual variations

- Homogamy advantage over hypergamy among women in Anglo-Saxon and Central & Eastern European countries
- Status attainment (hypogamy advantage) for men in Central & Eastern European countries and women in the Baltic states
- Hypergamy advantage for men in Southern Europe
- Weak or negligible effects of educational sorting in Continental European and Nordic countries

Normative climates

- The negative associations between hypergamy and women's life satisfaction was attenuated in contexts where hypergamy was highly normative.

## Abstract

Over the past decades, the patterns of educational sorting in marriage have changed dramatically in China, exhibiting a U-shaped curve for homogamy, an inverted U-shaped curve for hypergamy, and a consistently low prevalence of hypogamy. However, few studies have systematically examined why these changes occurred as they did. Using data from China's Census, this study employs a decomposition approach to unpack the contributions of three driving forces: educational expansion, educational gradients in marriage rates, and assortative mating preferences. Results show that the initial decrease in homogamy among cohorts born before 1965 was driven entirely by educational expansion. For later birth cohorts, sustained educational expansion promoted homogamy and hypogamy while discouraging hypergamy. This influence outweighed the opposing effects of a steeper decline in marriage rates among highly educated women. Preferences for homogamy and against heterogamy, especially hypogamy, intensified. Combined, the three factors explained the rising homogamy, declining hypergamy, and stagnant hypogamy across later cohorts.

## Research questions

1. How have patterns of marital sorting by education evolved across cohorts in China?
2. How do these patterns differ between urban and rural areas?
3. To what extent can these patterns be explained by educational expansion, educational gradients in marriage rates, and assortative mating preferences?

## Literature review

Assortative mating preferences

- Strengthening patterns of educational homogamy in China and other transitional sates ([[@dongTrendsEducationalAssortative2023]]; [[@duTrendsEducationalAssortative2023]]; [[@fengRevisitingHorizontalStratification2022]]; [[[@hanTrendsEducationalAssortative2010]]])
- Gender norms favoring hypergamy over hypogamy ([[@hanTrendsEducationalAssortative2010]])

Educational expansion

- In 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, about 80% of the population was illiterate or semi-illiterate, with an even higher percentage among women.
- By 1964, following campaigns to eradicate illiteracy and the expansion of primary and middle schools, this number had been halved.
- While higher education was thrown into turmoil by the Cultural Revolution, educational expansion did not halt for secondary or lower education.
- The 1980s and beyond saw a revival of higher education, culminating in the state-implemented college expansion in 1999.

Educational gradients in marriage rates

- Marriage is associated with a whole package of family obligations and expectations.
	- Quick transition to parenthood ([[@tongResistantChangeTransition2017]])
	- Double burden of paid and unpaid labor ([[@luoGenderDivisionHousehold2018]])
	- Intensive mothering ([[@guParentingSuccessValue2021]]; [[@guSacrificeIndebtednessIntergenerational2022]])
- Highly educated women are more likely to delay or forgo marriage than their less-educated counterparts ([[@huTooEducatedBe2023]]; [[@jiTraditionModernityLeftover2015]]; [[@jiUnequalCareUnequal2017]]).
- Men with lower education are often squeezed out of the marriage market ([[@jiangMarriageSqueezeNeverMarried2014]]).

The urban-rural divide

- Uneven educational expansion ([[@treimanDifferenceHeavenEarth2012]]; [[@treimanTrendsEducationalAttainment2013]]; [[@yeungHigherEducationExpansion2013]])
- Marriage, as an institution, is more strongly entrenched among the rural population.
- Urban couples' educational statuses were consistently more strongly correlated than those of rural couples ([[@duTrendsEducationalAssortative2023]]).

## Data and methods

China's Census in 1982, 1990, 2000, and 2010

Sample

- Main analyses: a sample of 2,592,528 female respondents born between 1946 and 1985 of whom 2,447,778 were married, along with a reference sample of 2,679,757 men born between 1944 and 1983.
- Urban-rural comparison: a sample of 1,089,730 female respondents born between 1966 and 1985, among whom 992,698 were married, as well as a reference sample of 1,174,082 men born between 1964 and 1983.

Decomposition ([[@leeschDecomposingTrendsEducational2023]]; [[@leeschStructuralOpportunitiesAssortative2024]])

## Results

### Overall trends

The share of homogamy followed a U-shaped curve.

- In the first stage, it declined from 68.0% to as low as 52.1% across the 1946-1950 and 1961-1965 cohorts.
- In the second stage, it rebounded rapidly, exceeding 70% among cohorts born after 1976.
- There was a stark gap between observed and structural homogamy across cohorts, which widened significantly for those born after 1966, particularly in urban areas.

The proportion of hypergamous marriages followed an inverted U-shaped curve.

- It rose from 27.0% among the 1946-1950 cohorts to 35.6% among the 1961-1965 cohorts.
- Then, it declined to 18.3% among those born between 1981 and 1985.
- Hypergamy rates would have been higher if not for assortative mating preferences being increasingly against hypergamy.

The proportion of hypogamy remained stable.

- After an initial increase from 4.9% to 12.3% among older cohorts born in the 1960s or earlier, its prevalence declined following the 1961-1965 cohorts.
- Since then, it remained stagnant, fluctuating around 10% across later cohorts.
- The gap between observed and structural hypogamy, was much more pronounced in urban areas than in rural ones.

### Educational expansion and gradients in marriage rates

Educational expansion but with exacerbated urban-rural disparities

Marriage rates declined across the educational spectrum, most significantly among women with college or higher education, particularly for those in rural areas.

### Assortative mating preferences

Chinese couples exhibited strong preferences for homogamy and against heterogamy, and these preferences intensified among cohorts born in the 1960s or later.

Preferences against hypergamy were more pronounced among women with lower education.

Hypogamy was particularly unfavorable for women with higher education.

The initial decline in homogamy and the corresponding rise in hypergamy and hypogamy among the 1946-1950 and 1961-1965 cohorts were driven almost entirely by educational expansion.

For later cohorts, the rising homogamy was largely driven by educational expansion and shifts in assortative mating preferences, both of which increasingly favored homogamy.

The decline in hypergamy among these cohorts was primarily driven by educational expansion and assortative mating preferences against hypergamy.

The proportion of hypogamy declined from a peak of 12.3% among the 1960s cohorts to 9.3% among the 1980s cohorts. Although educational expansion led to the convergence of educational gaps between genders, creating structural conditions conducive to hypogamy, this effect was offset by two countervailing forces: declining marriage rates among highly educated women and assortative mating preferences, both of which became increasingly unfavorable to hypogamy over time.

Homogamy

- Educational expansion and assortative mating preferences more strongly favored homogamy than in urban areas.
- However, the steeper decline in marriage rates among highly educated women in rural regions worked against homogamy, and this effect intensified across cohorts, contributing to the narrowing of the urban-rural divide in homogamy among the 1980s cohorts.

Hypogamy

- The urban-rural differences in hypogamy diminished over time, from a 5.4 percentage point difference among the 1966-1970 cohorts to a small but still significant 2.6 percentage point difference among the 1981-1985 cohorts.
- Educational expansion was the main contributor.
- The remaining urban-rural divide was primarily due to stronger assortative mating preferences against hypogamy in rural areas compared to urban ones.

Hypergamy

- Hypergamy rates, initially higher in rural areas, converged across cohorts.
- Although education-specific marriage rates favored hypergamy more in rural regions, the effect was offset by the other two factors: educational composition and assortative mating preferences, both of which more strongly disfavored hypergamy in rural regions compared to urban ones.

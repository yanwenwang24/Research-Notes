### Measures

Labor force exit (dichotomous)

- Employed vs. unemployed/inactive

Ethnicity

- Han
- Hui
- Kazakh
- Korean
- Manchu
- Mongolian
- Southern
- Tibetan
- Uyghur

Interethnic marriage

- Dichotomous: intra- vs. inter-ethnic
- Ethnic pairing

### Methods

Multilevel logistic model

- Variation in labor force exit by ethnic group (pooled sample)
- Variation in labor force exit by ethnic pairing (samples stratified by ethnic group)

## Results

### Descriptive results

Description

### Model results

Unemployment by ethnic group

- Compared to Han women, Hui, Kazakh, Manchu, Mongolian, and Uyghur women were more likely to be unemployed, while Korean, Southern, and Tibetan women were less likely.

Unemployment by ethnic pairing

- Hui
	- No difference was found by ethnic pairing.
	- Spousal education was negatively associated with unemployment, except for those with low education in intra-ethnic marriage.
- Kazakh
	- No difference was found by either ethnic or educational pairing.
- Korean
	- No difference was found by ethnic pairing.
	- Spousal education was negatively associated with unemployment in intermarriage with Han but positively related to unemployment in intra-ethnic marriage.
- Manchu
	- Those in intermarriage with Han (-0.13) were less likely to be unemployed than those in intra-ethnic marriage.
	- Spousal education was negatively associated with unemployment, except for those with middle education in intermarriage with Han.
- Mongolian
	- Those in intermarriage with other minorities (0.39) were more likely to be unemployed than those in intra-ethnic marriage.
	- Spousal education was positively associated with unemployment for those with low education.
- Southern
	- Those in intermarriage with Han (0.51) were more likely to be unemployed than those in intra-ethnic marriage.
	- Spousal education was positively associated with unemployment, especially for those with low or middle education in intra-ethnic marriage.
- Tibetan
	- No difference was found by ethnic pairing.
	- Spousal education was positively associated with unemployment for those in intra-ethnic marriage and for those with middle education in intermarriage with Han.
- Uyghur
	- No difference was found by either ethnic or educational pairing.

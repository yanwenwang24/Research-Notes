## Research questions

1. How does educational mobility, as well as educational statuses at the origin and destination, affect the subjective well-being of both primary mover and their parents?
2. How do such associations vary by parent's and child's gender, as well as by the only-child status?

## Literature review

Educational mobility and subjective well-being

- Acculturation theory emphasizes the impact of origin and destination on mobile individuals' well-being ([[@blauSocialMobilityInterpersonal1956]]).
- Dissociative theory suggests that individuals are estranged from both origin and mobility ([[@sorokin1927social]]; [[@sorokin1959social]]).
- Multiple discrepancy theory indicates that individuals are better off when moving upwards, but hurt by downward mobility even more ([[@michalosMultipleDiscrepanciesTheory1985]]; [[@newmanFallingGraceDownward1999]]).

What about the older generation?

- Linked lives and the life course perspective ([[@bengtsonLifecoursePerspectiveAgeing2005]]; [[@elderFamilyHistoryLife1977]]; [[@elderFamiliesLivesDevelopments1987]]; [[@macmillanFamiliesLifeCourse2005]])
- Parents' well-being is strongly influenced by life events and conditions of children, including health, marriage, education, and employment ([[@chenEducationFeverChina2021]]; [[@friedmanSchoolingOffspringSurvival2014]]; [[@maDoesAdultChildrens2022]]; [[@zhangChildrensTransitionsAdulthood2023]]; [[@tongChildrensAcademicPerformance2021]]; [[@xuHopingPhoenixShanghai2013]])

Gender and the only-child status

- Only-child's success ([[@falboQuantitativeReviewOnly1986]]; [[@liuWhoBenefitsBeing2021]])
- Parent-child gender contracts ([[@fongChinasOneChildPolicy2002]]; [[@wuFertilityDeclineWomens2014]]; [[@liuBoysOnlychildrenGirls2006]])

## Hypotheses

*Hypothesis 1:* Subjective well-being is affected and only affected by origin and destination. Once these are accounted for, no additional mobility effects remain.

*Hypothesis 2:* Subjective well-being is affected by mobility, net of origin and destination.

- Subjective well-being is positively associated with upward mobility and negatively related to downward mobility, with the latter having a larger absolute effect.
- Subjective well-being is negatively associated with mobility in either direction.

*Hypothesis 3a:* Among primary movers, the relative influence of origin (compared to destination) on subjective well-being, as well as the effects of net mobility, is greater for only children than for those with siblings.

*Hypothesis 3b:* Among only children, the relative influence of destination (compared to origin) on subjective well-being, as well as the effects of net mobility, is greater for sons than for daughters.

*Hypothesis 3c:* Among parents, the relative influence of destination (compared to origin), as well as the effects of net mobility, is greater for parents with an only son than for those with an only daughter. Differences by child's gender may be greater for mothers than for fathers.

*Hypothesis 4:* Among parents, the relative influence of destination (compared to origin) on subjective well-being, as well as the effects of mobility, is greater for mothers than for fathers.

## Data and methods

The China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2010

A sample of 16,385 primary movers (of which 1,475 were only children) and a sample of 3,808 parents of only children

Diagonal mobility models ([[@sobelDiagonalMobilityModels1981]]; [[@sobelSocialMobilityFertility1985]])

## Results

The subjective well-being of both generations was influenced by origin and destination, with a more pronounced effect from their own education.

Both parents and their children were not better off because of upward mobility. However, their well-being was negatively associated with downward mobility--a phenomenon observed exclusively among those in only-child families.

Among these parents, mothers with an upwardly mobile daughter reported the highest life satisfaction.

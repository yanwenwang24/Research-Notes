## Abstract

In multiethnic societies, interethnic marriage serves as a critical lens for understanding cultural integration and status hierarchies among ethnic groups. Using data from China's Census (1982-2010), we examine how these dynamics unfold in a context where ethnic disparities intersect with state interventions through preferential policies. Although uncommon, intermarriage with the Han majority gradually increased, occurring most frequently among the Manchu, Mongolian, and Southern minorities, and least frequently among the Kazakh and Uyghur. After controlling for ethnic compositions, all minority groups exhibited preferences against intermarriage with the Han, with the strongest disinclination observed among groups maintaining distinct ethnoreligious identities (e.g., Kazakh, Uyghur). Over time, these cultural boundaries became increasingly permeable for most groups except the Manchu, and patterns of gender asymmetry largely dissipated. Our analysis of educational patterns reveals two distinct mechanisms for boundary crossing: relatively assimilated groups (e.g., Hui, Manchu, Mongolian) through educational assortative mating, and status exchange among groups with strong but permeable boundaries. The Koreans leveraged their educational advantage to marry Han spouses, while Han Chinese needed higher education to marry into Tibetan and Southern minoritiesâ€”groups that receive the most substantial policy advantages. Notably, the Uyghur and Kazakh populations maintained rigid boundaries unaffected by either mechanism. These findings reveal how marriage choices reflect complex negotiations between cultural preservation, social mobility, and state-structured incentives, providing insights into the persistence and malleability of ethnic boundaries in contemporary societies.

3. Explore the role of educational attainment in transcending boundaries.
	- Educational assortative mating
	- Status exchange

## Literature review

### The new assimilation theory

A less ethnocentric, non-deterministic view of assimilation, where the dominant culture is no longer the normative standard, and the erosion of ethnic boundaries occurs through an intermingling process between minority and majority populations ([[@albaRemakingAmericanMainstream2005]])

Instrumental considerations

> the unintended consequences of practical strategies and actions undertaken in the pursuit of familiar goals (p. 41)

### Ethnic landscape in China

55 minority ethnic group, the result of the Ethnic Identification Project finalized in 1982

Varying degrees of assimilation, illustrated by eight major categories ([[@maEthnicRelationsChina2022]])

- Relatively assimilated: Manchu, Mongolian, Korean
- Muslim groups: Hui, Kazakh, Uyghur
- Remote regions: Tibetan, Southern minorities

### Gender asymmetry in majority-minority intermarriage

Overview

- Definition: systematic differences in the rates at which men and women from particular ethnic groups marry outside their group
- Example: Black-White interracial marriages in the U.S. were historically more likely to involve Black husbands than Black wives.
- Importance: These patterns illuminate how gender intersects with ethnic identity to create distinct opportunities and constraints in the marriage market, reflecting and reinforcing broader inequalities between and within minority and majority communities.

Overview of the Chinese context

- Gender asymmetry in boundary crossing takes on particular significance in the Chinese context, where they intersect with strong patrilineal traditions.
- In China, organizations of families and ethnic groups are deeply influenced by patrilineality, where family membership, inheritance, and identity pass through the male line.
- Children of interethnic couples typically inherit their father's ethnic status, especially when the child is a son, and the father belongs to a minority group ([[@muFollowFatherMother2024]]).
- These greater responsibilities on sons to continue family and ethnic lineages create stronger pressure on minority men to marry within ethnic group, while minority women may face fewer such restrictions.

Variation across minority groups

- We, therefore, expect overall higher intermarriage rates with Han Chinese among minority women than minority men, net of gender compositions.
- We anticipate variations across minority groups.
	- Specifically, relatively assimilated groups (e.g., Manchu) will likely show minimal gender differences, as their weaker ethnic boundaries and cultural proximity to Han Chinese reduce the salience of patrilineal restrictions.
	- In contrast, groups maintaining more distinct ethnic identities (e.g., Korean, Tibetan, Southern minorities) may exhibit stronger gender asymmetry with higher intermarriages among women.
	- This is particularly the case for Islamic groups (e.g., Kazakh, Uyghur), where religious beliefs intersect with patrilineal traditions to create strict restrictions on women's out-marriage.
- Finally, we expect these gender asymmetries to weaken over time with modernization, though at different rates across groups depending on changes in their ethnic boundaries.

### Educational attainment and interethnic marriage

Educational assortative mating is an effective yet insufficient force for boundary crossing.

Status exchange provides an alternative pathway to interethnic marriage when educational assortative mating proves ineffective.

- China presents a notable exception where the status hierarchy across ethnic groups exhibits far greater complexity than simple majority-minority differentials would suggest.

## Hypotheses

*Hypothesis 1.* Minority ethnic groups with more distinct identities (e.g., Kazakhs, Uyghurs) are less likely to intermarry with the Han majority, after controlling for ethnic composition.

*Hypothesis 2.* Due to patrilineal traditions, minority women have higher rates of intermarriage with Han Chinese than minority men, after controlling for gender composition.

- Gender asymmetry in intermarriage varies by ethnic group, with:
	- Minimal gender differences among highly assimilated groups (e.g., Manchu)
	- Stronger asymmetry (higher female intermarriage rates) among groups with distinct identities (e.g., Korean, Tibetan)
	- Most pronounced asymmetry among Islamic groups (e.g., Kazakh, Uyghur) where religious traditions reinforce restrictions on women's marriage behaviors
- Gender asymmetry in interethnic marriage weakens over time, particularly among ethnic groups with weakening ethnic boundaries.

*Hypothesis 3.* The likelihood of intermarriage with the Han majority increases across different levels of educational homogamy among ethnic minorities with less salient ethnic identities and similar standings to the Han, after accounting for both partners' ethnic and educational composition.

*Hypothesis 4.* Ethnic minorities with strong but permeable boundaries and different standings from the Han majority (e.g., Koreans, Tibetans) are more likely to engage in status exchange in intermarriages with the Han.

- Ethnic minorities receiving substantial preferential policies (e.g., Tibetans) tend to marry Han spouses with higher educational attainment than would be available to them in intra-ethnic marriage, exchanging their policy advantages for better socioeconomic prospects, while Han individuals exchange their higher educational attainment for policy benefits.
- Ethnic minorities with socioeconomic advantages but minimal policy benefits (e.g., Koreans) tend to marry Han spouses with lower educational attainment than would be available to them in intra-ethnic marriage, exchanging their socioeconomic resources for majority status, while Han individuals exchange their majority status for better socioeconomic prospects.

## Results

### Descriptive results

| Year                             | 1982   | 1990   | 2000   | 2010   |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Intra-ethnic marriage            | 98.11% | 97.20% | 96.59% | 96.30% |
| Intermarriage with the Han       | 1.86%  | 2.75%  | 3.34%  | 3.61%  |
| Intermarriage between minorities | 0.02%  | 0.06%  | 0.07%  | 0.09%  |

Overall trends

- Interethnic marriage nearly doubled from 1.86% in 1982 to 3.61% in 2010.
- Intermarriages between different minority groups, while increasing, remained rare.

Variations across ethnic groups

- By 2010, interethnic marriage was most prevalent among the Manchu (46.34%), Mongolian (45.83), and Korean (27.71%) populations, followed by Southern minorities (19.82%), Hui (12.12%), and Tibetan (6.35%).
- The lowest rates were observed among groups with salient ethnoreligious identitiesâ€”the Kazakh (3.06%) and Uyghur (0.48%)â€”and the Han majority (2.00%).
- The Korean population showed the most dramatic increase in intermarriage rates, rising more than tenfold from 2.55% in 1982 to 27.71% in 2010.
- This remarkable weakening of ethnic boundaries was also evident among the Mongolian (72.49% increase) and Southern minorities (49.47% increase).
- Ethnic boundaries strengthened among the Manchu, whose intermarriage rates decreased by 33.89%, with the sharpest decline occurring between 1982 and 1990.
- The Hui and Kazakh populations saw increasing intermarriage rates through 1990, but this trend reversed in subsequent decades.
- Tibetan boundaries similarly fluctuatedâ€”intermarriage rates peaked at 10.96% in 2000 before retreating to 6.35% in 2010, comparable to 1982-1990 levels.
- The Uyghur population maintained particularly rigid boundaries throughout the period, with intermarriage rates consistently below 1%, with a brief exception in 2000.

Gender asymmetry

- Among the Mongolian, Korean, Tibetan, and Southern minorities, women had higher intermarriage rates than men.
- The Hui maintained relatively symmetric gender patterns in intermarriage, while Manchu and Han populations had slightly higher rates among men.
- Among the Kazakh, the initial male dominance in interethnic marriage (5.08% for men vs. 1.93% for women in 1982) gave way to higher female intermarriage rates by 2010. The Uyghur population experienced a similar reversal of gender gaps in intermarriage rates, but in the opposite direction.

Educational attainment and interethnic marriage

- There were positive and widening educational gradients in intermarriage rates for the Hui, Manchu, Mongolian, and Southern minorities.
- The Korean minority exhibited a reverse patternâ€”their most dramatic increase in intermarriage occurred among the less educated, rising from 3.34% in 1982 to 50% in 2010, surpassing rates among those with middle (15.63%) and high (34.04%) education.

Variations across groups

- The Manchu showed the weakest barriers, with coefficients around -2.7, indicating relatively higher intermarriage propensity with Han.
- At the other end of the spectrum, the Kazakh and Uyghur demonstrated the strongest barriers, with coefficients ranging from -7 to -10, suggesting much lower likelihood of intermarriage.

Temporal changes

- Most groups showed increasing openness to intermarriage over time.
	- The Southern minorities exhibited a steady decrease in barriers, with coefficients moving from -3.64 to -2.94.
	- Similarly, Korean marriages showed consistent weakening of barriers, with coefficients changing substantially from -6.91 to -4.75.
	- The Mongolian group demonstrated increasing openness, with barriers decreasing from -4.02 to -3.13.
	- The Hui exhibited overall stable barriers, with increasing openness between 1982 and 1990.
- The Manchu show strengthening boundaries over time, with coefficients decreasing from -2.42 in 1982 to -2.81 in 2010.
- The Kazakh and Uyghur groups showed some fluctuation but persistent strong boundaries against intermarriage with Han.

| Uyghur         | -0.321 (0.231)   | 0.165   |

Overall patterns

- Manchu and Hui show positive coefficients (0.168 and 0.073 respectively), indicating a higher likelihood of marriages between minority men and Han women. For Manchu, this pattern is highly significant (p<0.001) with an odds ratio of 1.183, suggesting Manchu men are 18.3% more likely to marry Han women than Manchu women are to marry Han men. The Hui pattern is weaker but still significant (p=0.026).
- Korean, Mongolian, Southern, and Tibetan groups show significantly negative coefficients, indicating a stronger tendency for Han men to marry minority women.
	- The odds ratios indicate that, for example, Southern minority women are about 31.4% more likely to marry Han men than Southern minority men are to marry Han women.

Temporal patterns

- The Manchu and Korean groups show decreasing gender asymmetry over time (from -1.339 in 1982 to an insignificant -0.105 in 2010).
- Mongolians show a reversal in gender asymmetry patterns (from 0.174 in 1982 to negative coefficients in later years).
- Southern and Tibetan minorities maintained consistent, or even increasing, gender asymmetry favoring intermarraiges between Han husbands and minority wives.

For relatively assimilated groups (e.g., the Hui, Manchu, Mongolian), intermarriage barriers decreased with higher education. The coefficients become less negative from lower to higher levels of educational homogamy, suggesting that education facilitates intermarriage through assortative mating.

For groups with strong but permeable boundaries, like Southern and Tibetan minorities, there were no clear educational gradients in Han intermarriage patterns.

For groups with strong boundaries like the Kazakh and Uyghur, the large standard errors and extremely negative coefficients across all educational pairings suggest that education plays little role in facilitating intermarriage.

### Status exchange

| Ethnic Pair   | Husband's $EI$ | Wife's $EI$ |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Han-Hui       | 11.15***       | 6.98***     |
| Hui-Han       | 12.08***       | 2.28***     |
| Han-Korean    | 11.67***       | -4.76***    |
| Korean-Han    | -3.49**        | 3.5*        |
| Han-Manchu    | 8.06***        | 0.53        |
| Manchu-Han    | 4.34***        | -0.52*      |
| Han-Mongolian | 5.76***        | 2.8***      |
| Mongolian-Han | 4.45***        | 1.79***     |
| Han-Southern  | -2.52***       | 0.66**      |
| Southern-Han  | 7.25***        | -0.7**      |
| Han-Tibetan   | -7.41***       | 11.75***    |
| Tibetan-Han   | 13.14***       | -4.3**      |

Korean-Han marriages demonstrated classic status exchange: Koreans leveraged their educational advantage to marry Han spouses.

Tibetan-Han and Southern-Han marriages exhibited *reverse* status exchange patterns. Han Chinese required higher educational attainment to marry into these minority groups, which receive substantial policy advantages.

Relatively assimilated groups (Hui, Manchu, and Mongolian) displayed positive assortative mating rather than status exchange. Both partners in these marriages demonstrated higher educational investment compared to what would be typical in intra-ethnic marriages, suggesting that education facilitates intermarriage through matching on similar educational levels rather than exchange of status characteristics.

- The Hui's increasing openness to intermarriage with the Han was particularly pronounced in North, Northeast, Southwest, and Northwest China, while less evident in East and South Central China.
- The ethnic boundaries of Mongolians became more permeable over time, though with different temporal patterns across regions: consistent changes from 1982 to 2010 in the Northeast and Northwest, compared to changes between 1982-1990 followed by stabilization in the North.
- Tibetans and Southern minorities demonstrated more substantial boundary weakening in specific regions (Northwest and Southwest China, respectively).
- The Manchus stood out as the only group with strengthening ethnic boundaries, particularly in North China.
- For other geographically concentrated minority populations (e.g., Korean, Kazakh, Uyghur), the regional patterns reflected the trends observed in our national analysis.

Gender asymmetry

- We found little evidence supporting positive gender asymmetry (i.e., higher intermarriage rates for minority men compared to minority women) among the Hui population in most regions of China, except in the East, suggesting an overall gender-symmetric patterns of intermarriage.
- Among the Manchu population, the positive gender asymmetry was found in North and Northeast China, but largely disappeared after 2000.
- Similar to the national analyses, we found negative but weakening gender asymmetry patterns among the Mongolian, Korean, Southern, and Tibetan minorities across regions, but these patterns mostly disappeared into 2010.
- For the Kazakhs and Uyghurs, the absence of gender asymmetry is consistnet with national findings.

Educational assortative mating

- The Hui population showed strong educational gradients in most regions, except in Northeast China where intermarriage ratios rose from 3.51 to 17.10 for low- and middle-education pairs but declined to 13.63 for high-education pairs.
- The Manchus in North China showed a non-linear pattern with similar ratios for low- and middle-education pairs (127.13 and 113.0) but a sharp increase for high-education pairs (221.49), while Northeast China displayed steady increases (189.93, 231.10, and 290.50).
- The Mongolian population exhibited varying gradients
	- A marked difference between low- and middle-education pairs compared to high-education pairs in North China (36.05 and 29.34 vs. 80.86, respectively)
	- Moderate but statistically insignificant increases in Northeast China (38.60, 47.80, and 53.60, respectively)
	- Similar patterns in Northwest China (4.86, 7.55, and 15.36, respectively).
- For Korean, Southern minorities, and Tibetan populations, the absence of educational gradients persisted across regions.

Status exchange

- Strong evidence of traditional status exchange among Korean-Han couples (though insignificant from husbands' perspective in Korean husband-Han wife marriages)
- Inverse status exchange patterns among minorities receiving substantial policy benefits, though with notable regional variations
	- Southern minorities, particularly in Southwest China where their population was most concentrated, exhibited strong inverse status exchange. This pattern weakened considerably in East China and became negligible in South Central China where policy benefits were less substantial.
	- Status exchange in Tibetan-Han intermarriages was more pronounced in Southwest than Northwest China.

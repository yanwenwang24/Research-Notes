## Abstract

In multiethnic societies, interethnic marriage serves as a critical lens for understanding cultural integration and status hierarchies among ethnic groups. Using data from China's Census (1982-2010), we examine how these dynamics unfold in a context where ethnic disparities intersect with state interventions through preferential policies. Although uncommon, intermarriage with the Han majority gradually increased, occurring most frequently among the Manchu, Mongolian, and Southern minorities, and least frequently among the Kazakh and Uyghur. After controlling for ethnic compositions, all minority groups exhibited preferences against intermarriage with the Han, with the strongest disinclination observed among groups maintaining distinct ethnoreligious identities (e.g., Kazakh, Uyghur). These cultural boundaries became increasingly permeable over time for most groups except the Manchu. Patterns of gender asymmetry varied across groups: Manchu showed higher likelihood of minority men marrying Han women, while Korean, Mongolian, Southern, and Tibetan groups exhibited stronger tendencies for minority women marrying Han men. Our analysis of educational patterns reveals two distinct mechanisms for boundary crossing: relatively assimilated groups (e.g., Hui, Manchu, Mongolian) through educational assortative mating, and status exchange among groups with strong but permeable boundaries. Koreans leveraged their educational advantage to marry Han spouses, while Han Chinese needed higher education to marry into Tibetan and Southern minoritiesâ€”groups that receive the greatest policy advantages. Notably, the Uyghur and Kazakh populations, despite also receiving substantial policy advantages, maintain rigid ethnic boundaries unaffected by either mechanism. These findings reveal how marriage choices reflect complex negotiations between cultural preservation, social mobility, and state-structured incentives, providing insights into the persistence and malleability of ethnic boundaries in contemporary societies.

Variations across groups
- The Manchu showed the weakest barriers, with coefficients around -2.7, indicating relatively higher intermarriage propensity with Han.
- At the other end of the spectrum, the Kazakh and Uyghur demonstrated the strongest barriers, with coefficients ranging from -7 to -10, suggesting much lower likelihood of intermarriage.

Temporal changes
- Most groups showed increasing openness to intermarriage over time.
	- The Southern minorities exhibited a steady decrease in barriers, with coefficients moving from -3.64 to -2.94.
	- Similarly, Korean marriages showed consistent weakening of barriers, with coefficients changing substantially from -6.91 to -4.75.
	- The Mongolian group demonstrated increasing openness, with barriers decreasing from -4.02 to -3.13.
	- The Hui exhibited overall stable barriers, with increasing openness between 1982 and 1990.
- The Manchu show strengthening boundaries over time, with coefficients decreasing from -2.42 in 1982 to -2.81 in 2010.
- The Kazakh and Uyghur groups showed some fluctuation but persistent strong boundaries against intermarriage with Han.

| Hui            | 0.073 (0.033)    | 0.026   |
| Kazakh         | -0.251 (0.258)   | 0.331   |
| Korean         | -0.358 (0.087)   | <0.001  |
| Manchu         | 0.168 (0.023)    | <0.001  |
| Mongolian      | -0.212 (0.029)   | <0.001  |
| Southern       | -0.378 (0.018)   | <0.001  |

| Uyghur         | -0.321 (0.231)   | 0.165   |

Overall patterns
- Manchu and Hui show positive coefficients (0.168 and 0.073 respectively), indicating a higher likelihood of marriages between minority men and Han women. For Manchu, this pattern is highly significant (p<0.001) with an odds ratio of 1.183, suggesting Manchu men are 18.3% more likely to marry Han women than Manchu women are to marry Han men. The Hui pattern is weaker but still significant (p=0.026).
- Korean, Mongolian, Southern, and Tibetan groups show significantly negative coefficients, indicating a stronger tendency for Han men to marry minority women.
	- The odds ratios indicate that, for example, Southern minority women are about 31.4% more likely to marry Han men than Southern minority men are to marry Han women.

Temporal patterns
- The Manchu and Korean groups show decreasing gender asymmetry over time (from -1.339 in 1982 to an insignificant -0.105 in 2010).
- Mongolians show a reversal in gender asymmetry patterns (from 0.174 in 1982 to negative coefficients in later years).
- Southern and Tibetan minorities maintained consistent, or even increasing, gender asymmetry favoring intermarraiges between Han husbands and minority wives.

|              | Homo3     | -14.575 (99.322)|

For relatively assimilated groups (e.g., the Hui, Manchu, Mongolian), intermarriage barriers decreased with higher education. The coefficients become less negative from lower to higher levels of educational homogamy, suggesting that education facilitates intermarriage through assortative mating.

For groups with strong but permeable boundaries, like Southern and Tibetan minorities, there were no clear educational gradients in Han intermarriage patterns.

For groups with strong boundaries like the Kazakh and Uyghur, the large standard errors and extremely negative coefficients across all educational pairings suggest that education plays little role in facilitating intermarriage.

### Status exchange

| Ethnic Pair   | Husband's $EI$ | Wife's $EI$ |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Han-Hui       | 11.15***       | 6.98***     |
| Hui-Han       | 12.08***       | 2.28***     |
| Han-Korean    | 11.67***       | -4.76***    |
| Korean-Han    | -3.49**        | 3.5*        |
| Han-Manchu    | 8.06***        | 0.53        |
| Manchu-Han    | 4.34***        | -0.52*      |
| Han-Mongolian | 5.76***        | 2.8***      |
| Mongolian-Han | 4.45***        | 1.79***     |
| Han-Southern  | -2.52***       | 0.66**      |
| Southern-Han  | 7.25***        | -0.7**      |
| Han-Tibetan   | -7.41***       | 11.75***    |
| Tibetan-Han   | 13.14***       | -4.3**      |

Korean-Han marriages demonstrated classic status exchange: Koreans leveraged their educational advantage to marry Han spouses.

Tibetan-Han and Southern-Han marriages exhibited *reverse* status exchange patterns. Han Chinese required higher educational attainment to marry into these minority groups, which receive substantial policy advantages.

Relatively assimilated groups (Hui, Manchu, and Mongolian) displayed positive assortative mating rather than status exchange. Both partners in these marriages demonstrated higher educational investment compared to what would be typical in intra-ethnic marriages, suggesting that education facilitates intermarriage through matching on similar educational levels rather than exchange of status characteristics.

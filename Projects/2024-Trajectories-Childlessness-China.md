## Abstract

**Objective:** Drawing on the life course perspective, this study examines partnership trajectories of childless individuals to understand the drivers and processes of becoming childless in China.

**Background:** Despite the rising childlessness in China, little is known about the within-group heterogeneity in partnership trajectories leading to childlessness and their sociodemographic correlates.

**Methods:** The study employs sequence analysis and multinomial and ordinary least square regressions using a sample of 778 childless men and women aged 40 and above from the China Family Panel Studies in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018.

**Results:** Five clusters of partnership trajectories were identified: never-partnered (51.8%), early marriage (24.8%), late marriage (9.4%), on-time marriage (9.3%), and unpartnered via divorce or widowhood (4.9%). Men with low socioeconomic status were most likely to become childless through never marrying and their privileged counterparts mostly through on-time or late marriage. The early marriage and unpartnered clusters mostly consisted of women, and among women, those with an urban *hukou* or low education were more likely to be divorced. The overall heterogeneity in partnership trajectories to childlessness declined, and most complexity observed was limited to the unpartnered cluster.

**Conclusion:** Partnership trajectories to childlessness in China are heterogenous and stratified but increasingly homogenous.

**Implications:** Due to the persistent connections between marriage and childbearing, Chinese individuals become childless through more standardized life course trajectories than before.

## Research questions

1. What types of partnership trajectories lead to childlessness?
2. How do these pathways vary by major sociodemographic characteristics, including gender, cohort, education, and household registration status (*hukou*)?
3. Have they become more complex and heterogeneous across cohorts?

## Data and methods

The China Family Panel Studies in 2010-2018

A sample of 778 childless respondents with full marriage history from age 15 to 40

Sequence analysis

## Results

Five clusters of partnership trajectories

- Never-partnered (51.8%)
- Early marriage (24.8%)
- Late marriage (9.4%)
- On-time marriage (9.3%)
- Unpartnered via divorce or widowhood (4.9%)

Gender variation

- Men with low socioeconomic status were most likely to become childless through never marrying and their privileged counterparts mostly through on-time or late marriage.
- The early marriage and unpartnered clusters mostly consisted of women.
- Among women, those with an urban *hukou* or low education were more likely to be divorced.

Cohort variation

- The overall heterogeneity in partnership trajectories to childlessness declined, and most complexity observed was limited to the unpartnered cluster.

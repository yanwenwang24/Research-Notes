### Data and sample

A sample of 456,714 respondents selected from Census in 2005, 2010, and 2015

| Step | Filter Description                      | Remaining Sample | Dropped   | Drop Rate |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1    | Age â‰¥ 60                                | 923,891          | 5,985,855 | 86.63%    |
| 2    | Non-missing health                      | 910,645          | 13,246    | 1.43%     |
| 3    | Married only                            | 654,986          | 255,659   | 28.07%    |
| 4    | Non-missing ethnicity (self and spouse) | 456,714          | 198,272   | 30.27%    |
| 5    | Non-missing education (self and spouse) | 456,714          | 0         | 0.00%     |

### Measures

Dependent variable: self-rated health (dichotomous)

| Health | Census 2005 | Census 2010 | Census 2015 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Healthy; able to ensure normal work and life; | Healthy; mostly healthy | Healthy; mostly healthy |
| 0 | Cannot ensure a normal work and life; cannot tell | Not healthy, but can manage life independently; cannot manage life independently | Not healthy, but can manage life independently; cannot manage life independently |

Independent variables

- Ethnic group (self and spouse)
	- Han
	- Kazakh
	- Korean
	- Manchu
	- Mongolian
	- Southern
	- Tibetan
	- Uyghur
- Interethnic marriage indicator (whether spouse belongs to the same ethnic group)
- Educational sorting indicators (homogamy, upwards, downwards)
- Covariates
	- Level 1: female, age, migrant, education, employment, household size
	- Level 2: co-ethnic presence, entropy, education, basic facilities (percentage of households with kitchen and toilet)

### Analytic strategy

Multilevel logistic regression

Pooled

- Self ethnicity + whether interethnic marriage
- Self ethnicity + spousal ethnicity (+ interaction terms)

By ethnicity

- Ethnicity-Ethnicity vs. Ethnicity-Han vs. Han-Han marriages

### Data and sample

A sample of 456,531 respondents selected from Census in 2005, 2010, and 2015

| Step | Filter Description                                    | Remaining Sample | Dropped   | Drop Rate |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0    | Initial sample size                                   | 6,909,746        |           |           |
| 1    | Age â‰¥ 60                                              | 923,891          | 5,985,855 | 86.63%    |
| 2    | Non-missing health                                    | 910,645          | 13,246    | 1.43%     |
| 3    | Married only                                          | 654,986          | 255,659   | 28.07%    |
| 4    | Non-missing ethnicity and education (self and spouse) | 456,714          | 198,272   | 30.27%    |
| 5    | Non-missing covariates                                | 456,531          | 183       | 0.04%     |

### Measures

Dependent variable: self-rated health (dichotomous)

| Health | Census 2005 | Census 2010 | Census 2015 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Healthy; able to ensure normal work and life; | Healthy; mostly healthy | Healthy; mostly healthy |
| 0 | Cannot ensure a normal work and life; cannot tell | Not healthy, but can manage life independently; cannot manage life independently | Not healthy, but can manage life independently; cannot manage life independently |

Independent variables

- Ethnic group (self and spouse)
	- Han
	- Kazakh
	- Korean
	- Manchu
	- Mongolian
	- Southern
	- Tibetan
	- Uyghur
- Covariates
	- Level 1: female, age, migrant, education, employment, household size
	- Level 2: co-ethnic presence, entropy, education, basic facilities (percentage of households with kitchen and toilet)

### Analytic strategy

Multilevel logistic regression by ethnic group

- Spousal ethnicity (+ gender interaction)
- Han-Han vs. minority-minority vs. minority-Han

## Results

Health variations across ethnic groups

- Compared to Han, Kazakh, Manchu, Southern, and Uyghur had significantly worse health.

By ethnic group

- Hui: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.
- Kazakh: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.
- Korean: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.
- Manchu: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.
- ==Mongolian==: Those in intermarriage with Manchu had worse health than those in intermarriage with Han.
- ==Southern==: Those in intra-ethnic marriage or intermarriage with Mongolians had worse health than those in intermarriage with Han.
- Tibetan: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.
- Uyghur: Health did not differ across spousal ethnic groups.

Overall, we found little evidence supporting health disadvantages associated with interethnic marriage.

## Abstract

Based on data from Chinese General Social Survey and Survey of Life Histories and Social Change in Contemporary China, this paper examines the trend of educational assortative mating in mainland China by using log-linear model. The results reveal an N-shape fluctuation. From 1949 to 1954, educational homogamy grew dramatically, while it dropped gradually from 1955 to 1984. Since 1985, educational homogamy has again increased rapidly. Long-distance educational heterogamy was common during the period of the Cultural Revolution, while it was rare before and after the Cultural Revolution. Further, the marriage between people with high school and middle school education and those with primary school or lower degree, which was mainly driven by public policy, was more prevalent in the early years of the People's Republic of China, the period of Cultural Revolution and the early years of reform and opening up, and peaked during the Cultural Revolution.

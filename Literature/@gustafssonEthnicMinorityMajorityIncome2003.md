## Abstract

Gustafsson and Li (2003) directly assess the differences in rural income between the Han majority and ethnic minorities using household survey data of nineteen provinces in 1988 and 1995. They ﬁnd that the earlier period's per capita income gap of 19.2 percent grew to 35.9 percent in the latter period. Their decomposition of the observed income differential into differences due to endowments and treatment reveals that the vast majority of the differential is due to differences in endowments, particularly location. They find that minority incomes to be lower than Han incomes, largely because minorities are clustered in provinces with low per capita GDP and tend to dwell in mountainous areas as well as areas officially designated as poor ([[@maurer-fazioOceanFormedOne2007]]).

## Abstract

Using a subsample of 281 childless respondents aged 55 and over, we examine reported reasons for being childless and subjective childless status (self-definition of childlessness as a matter of choice or circumstance). The primary reason for childlessness among never married individuals is being single while the central reasons for childlessness among the ever-married are physiological factors, age, and fate. However, the reported reasons for childlessness vary within both marital status groups depending on whether respondents define their childlessness as a matter of choice or circumstance. Indeed, marital status and gender appear to be more closely related to childless status than are the actual reasons given for childlessness. The results show that the interaction between gender and marital status is a significant predictor of childless status, with widowed women most likely to define themselves as childless by circumstance.

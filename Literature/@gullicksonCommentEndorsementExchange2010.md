## Abstract

Comments on an article [[@rosenfeldCritiqueExchangeTheory2005]]. Rosenfeld proposes a new model using new data that shows no support for status exchange theory. Rosenfeld misspecifies his model and misinterprets his results. We re-estimate the model using a correct specification and find that Rosenfeld's data do in fact show evidence of status exchange between white women and black men, but not between white men and black women. Rosenfeld's model is flawed in two ways. First, Rosenfeld's parameterization of status exchange does not actually measure status exchange because it does not model different patterns of educational assortative mating between interracial and intraracial couples. Second, even if one corrects for Rosenfeld's error, the terms Rosenfeld includes in his models make the status exchange parameter itself an incomplete test of the theory. Rosenfeld argues that the recent use of complex log linear models is inferior to the simple kinds of tabular analysis. Rosenfeld also argues that his data are superior to census data because he captures short-duration marriages rather than younger couples. Like Rosenfeld, we are fans of robustness. However, we are more interested in the robustness of empirical results rather than the robustness of standard errors. For black male/white female couples, it has now also been found using Rosenfeld's own data.

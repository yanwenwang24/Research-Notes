## Abstract

The well-being implications of intergenerational educational mobility have been extensively studied, yet the focus predominantly lies on primary moversâ€”individuals who themselves move up or down the educational ladder. Less is known about the impact of adult children's educational mobility on their parents' subjective well-being. Moreover, the role of family structures and gender dynamics in shaping the well-being outcomes of such mobility has often been overlooked. The study employs the Diagonal Mobility Model ([[@sobelDiagonalMobilityModels1981]]; [[@sobelSocialMobilityFertility1985]]) to estimate the effects of net mobility on subjective well-being, independently of both parents' (origin) and their adult children's (destination) educational levels, using data from the 2010 China Family Panel Studies. The results show that the subjective well-being of both generations was influenced by origin and destination, with a more pronounced effect from their own education. Notably, downward mobility adversely affected individuals' and their parents' subjective well-being, a phenomenon observed exclusively among those in only-child families. Among these parents, mothers with an upwardly mobile daughter reported the highest life satisfaction. These findings point to a shift in the traditional gendered parent-child dynamics and underscore the adverse consequences of downward mobility that sway both generations in only-child families.

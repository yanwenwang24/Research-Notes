## Abstract

This chapter reviews the small but growing literature on intergenerational educational mobility in the developing world. Education is a critical determinant of economic well-being, and it predicts a range of non-pecuniary outcomes such as marriage, fertility, health, crime, and political attitudes. We show that developing nations feature stronger intergenerational educational persistence than high-income countries, in spite of substantial educational expansion in the last decades. We consider variations in mobility across gender and region, and discuss the macro-level correlates of educational mobility in developing countries. The chapter also discusses the literatures on concepts and measurement of educational mobility, theoretical perspectives to understand educational mobility across generations, and the role that education plays in the economic mobility process, and it applies these literatures to understand educational mobility in the developing world.

## Notes

**Absolute mobility** captures the total observed change in educational attainment across generations.

**Relative mobility** captures the association between parents' and children's education net of any change in the distribution of schooling across generations.

Measures

- Year of schooling, regression or correlation coefficient
- Ordered categories, log-linear models
- How to measure parental education?
	- Father's, mother's, dominance approach, or the joint approach?
- When to measure children's education?
	- mid-20s or older, or including school-aged children using timely grade progression?
	- The use of co-residential parentâ€“child dyads needs to restrict the sample to children younger than the normative age at which children leave the parental household.

Maximally maintained inequality (MMI) ([[@rafteryMaximallyMaintainedInequality1993]])

- Children of advantaged classes are "better prepared than are others to take advantage of new educational opportunities" ([[@ayalonEducationalReformsInequalities2004]]).

Effectively maintained inequality (EMI) ([[@lucasEffectivelyMaintainedInequality2001]])

- Horizontal inequality: Socioeconomically advantaged families will be able to obtain specific educational credentials within a particular level of schooling that provide them with enhanced opportunities for further attainment.

From parent-child dyad to a multigenerational population-level analysis (e.g., [[@choiHowMarriageMatters2020]]; [[@mareIntergenerationalEffectsChanges2006]])

China

- [[@magnaniSocialMobilityInequality2015]] found a decline in mobility for both sons and daughters between 1990 and 2000, using a census of co-resident parents and children in urban China.
- [[@liImpactHigherEducation2017]] found that in the context of rapid educational expansion, the association between parents' cadre membership and children's educational attainment has declined, but the association between parents' and children's education has increased over time.
- [[@chenIntergenerationalMobilityInstitutional2015]] found a U-shaped trend in intergenerational educational persistence among cohorts born between 1930 and 1985 in urban China.
- [[@emranOccupationalDualismIntergenerational2023]] found that educational mobility has increased for women but decreased among men (more on this gender disparity later), but limited educational mobility has been accompanied by massive upward occupational mobility.
- [[@golleyInequalityIntergenerationalMobility2013]] found a wide gap in mobility between urban and rural populations, with rural children more likely to experience downward educational mobility than their urban peers.
- [[@guoImpactsEducationPolicies2019]] found different effects of educational expansion policies in rural and urban populations. The compulsory education law of 1986 and the college expansion policy of 1999 promoted upward mobility in urban areas, but did not favor mobility in rural areas.
- [[@jinAreWeBorn2019]] found that education was the primary channel for income mobility.

## Abstract

Conducted 6 meta-analyses of 115 studies on only children (OCs) to evaluate the status of OCs. The meta-analyses focused on achievement, adjustment, character, intelligence, parent–child relationships, and sociability. Findings indicate that OCs were found to surpass all others except firstborns and people from 2-child families on achievement and intelligence. They also surpassed all non-OCs, especially people from families with 3 or more children, in character and they surpassed all non-OCs, especially those from large families, in the positivity of the parent–child relationship. Across all developmental outcomes, OCs were indistinguishable from firstborns and people from small families. Theories relating to OC deprivation and OC uniqueness were discredited by the results of the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses supported parent–child relationships as an important factor in producing the developmental outcomes attained by OCs, firstborns, and people from 2-child families. Studies included in the meta-analyses are appended. (63 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

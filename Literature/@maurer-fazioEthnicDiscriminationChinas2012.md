## Abstract

This study was inspired in part by Peter Kuhn and Kailing Shen's (2009) innovative use of China's Internet job boards to study the preferences on gender, age, height and beauty expressed by Chinese firms in their job ads and in part by conversations with Zahra Siddique at IZA about her dissertation work, which employed a resume audit methodology to investigate caste-basted discrimination in India's white-collar job market. I am very thankful to Rachel Connelly for her thoughtful feedback throughout the process of analyzing the data. I would also like to thank Reza Hasmath for his comments on earlier drafts of the paper and to acknowledge the valuable comments and questions about my initial findings from this journal's anonymous referee and the participants at the Conference on Ethnicity, Economy, and Society in China and the World in Beijing October 2011, the IAFFE Annual Conference in Barcelona June 2012, and the EALE Annual Conference in Bonn September 2012. I am particularly grateful for the expert research assistance provided by my undergraduate students, Sili Wang and Lei Lei, who carefully managed the application and tracking process.

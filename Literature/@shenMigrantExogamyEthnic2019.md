## Abstract

Drawing upon data from 2015 China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this article examines trends and patterns of migrant exogamy of China's ethnic minorities. We present estimates of exogamy rates of migrant ethnic minorities by education level, occupation and ethnic group. Compared with the exogamy rates derived from the Sixth Population Census, our results show that the exogamy rates of migrant ethnic minorities are higher than those of the overall ethnic minorities, while the exogamy rates vary across ethnic groups. Compared with the traditional exogamy circle of ethnic minorities, the exogamy circle of the migrant ethnic minorities has undergone great changes. The exogamy rates of migrant women are higher than those of migrant men. Improving educational level of ethnic minority population will play a positive role in promoting migration and exogamy of the ethnic minorities.

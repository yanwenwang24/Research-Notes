## Abstract

Data from China 2000 census shows that the minority population percentage has increased faster than han people. In addition to higher fertility, the choice of ethnic status by children from inter-ethnic marriage families may be another possible factor contributing to the change .This study conducts data-mining to the sample data from China population census in 2000, and depicts the mean age at first marriage and mean number of children ever born for interethnic marriage couples. In addition, this study finds out that children from interethnic marriage families are more inclined to identify themselves as minority ethnic. Finally, we evaluate the influence of such preference to minority status by the children from inter-ethnic marriage families on the growth of minority population.

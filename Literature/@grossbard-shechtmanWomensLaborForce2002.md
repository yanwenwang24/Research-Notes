## Abstract

Women's labor force participation, ethnic status and interracial marriage are examined in this paper to test Grossbard-Shechtman's ([[@grossbard-schectmanEconomicsMarriage1993]]; [[@grossbard-shechtmanTheoryAllocationTime1984]]) marriage market theory. Perceived racial and ethnic group status is found to be an important attribute in marriage market exchange that combines marriage and working outside the home. Caucasian women, who have a higher perceived ethnic status, tend not to work when they marry men of a lower perceived ethnic status, while the opposite is found of women who have a lower perceived group status and who marry into a higher-status group. This is especially of women with low education, while highly educated women are less affected by compensating differentials at marriage as related to ethnic status of the couple. Ethnic groups that have a recent immigration history also have a different pattern of intermarriage and women's labor force participation.

## Notes

How are intermarriages related to women's labor force participation?

- Caucasian
- Hawaiian
- Japanese
- Filipino

From status exchange to *compensating differentials*

- Status exchange: Members of lower status minorities who marry into the dominant group will exchange their inferior ethnic status for their partner's inferior status in another area (e.g., [[@fuRacialIntermarriagePairings2001]]; [[@houInterracialMarriageStatuscaste2013]]; [[@kalmijnIntermarriageHomogamyCauses1998]]; [[@qianBreakingRacialBarriers1997]]; [[@qianSocialBoundariesMarital2007]]; [[@torcheDecliningRacialStratification2017]])
- Compensating differentials: Men who come from groups perceived as less desirable will make above-average transfers of their earned income to a wife coming from a more desirable group, and the wife will be less likely to work for pay.

*Hypothesis 1:* Caucasian women working out of financial necessity and marrying out of their ethnic group are less likely to participate in the labor force than Caucasian women who work for the same reasons and married endogamously.

*Hypothesis 2:* The lower the perceived status of the husband's group, the higher the compensating differentials that a Caucasian wife is expected to receive in marriage, and the lower her predicted participation in the labor force if she works out of financial necessity.

*Hypothesis 3:* Among Caucasian women, the interaction of exogamy and education will be positively associated with labor force participation. In other words, for Caucasian women, the negative coefficient of out-marriage in a labor force participation regression will be smaller (in absolute value) for highly educated women than for less educated women.

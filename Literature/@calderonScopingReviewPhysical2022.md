## Abstract

**Objective**
A scoping review was conducted to document the literature of the impacts of being in a romantic partnership and better physical health and psychological well-being for individuals who are in an interracial romantic relationship.

**Background**
In the 50 years since Loving v. Virginia (1967) overturned the ban on interracial romantic relationships, the rates of interracial marriages have quintupled. Although being in a romantic relationship has been associated with better physical health and psychological well-being outcomes, the population of individuals in interracial romantic relationships has been overlooked.

**Method**
Informed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), the study's objectives, inclusion criteria, and methods of analysis for this review were specified in advance and documented. Fourteen studies met the scoping review's inclusion criteria.

**Results**
The articles were similar in five key areas: use of theory, methods, physical health outcomes, psychological well-being outcomes, and intimate partner violence. The findings across the studies suggest that individuals in interracial romantic relationships experience poorer physical health and psychological well-being compared with individuals who partner within their own race.

**Conclusion**
The theorized benefits of being in a romantic relationship do not seem to apply equally across individuals, particularly among those in interracial romantic relationships.

**Implications**
Providing support for interracial relationships is critical because the rates of these relationships are expected to increase, and individuals in these relationships are faring worse, despite being more than 50 years removed from anti-miscegenation laws.

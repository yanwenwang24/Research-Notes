## Abstract

This paper presents a novel theoretical framework examining the interdependence between labor and marriage markets, with particular focus on how marriage market conditions influence labor supply decisions. The author conceptualizes marriage as an exchange of household labor between spouses and develops a model incorporating four interrelated markets: male and female labor, and male and female household labor. The theory generates several key insights about labor supply, particularly for married women. It predicts that women's labor force participation varies with the sex ratio of eligible marriage partners, that income changes have stronger effects on wives' labor supply compared to husbands', and that women's labor supply exhibits more backward-bending properties than men's. The model also provides new perspectives on ethnic differences in labor supply elasticity and challenges previous theoretical conclusions about male income effects on fertility. The paper's framework yields implications beyond labor markets, offering insights into consumption patterns, fertility decisions, and marriage dynamics. The author suggests this integrated approach to labor and marriage markets could provide a useful framework for analyzing how public policies affect production, reproduction, and wealth distribution.

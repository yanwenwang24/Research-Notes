## Abstract

This paper analyzes changes in labor force participation rates over time for gender- and ethnicity-differentiated groups in urban China. From 1990 to 2000, urban labor force participation rates fell substantially with women's rates declining more rapidly than men's and minority women's declining more rapidly than Han women's. Women's labor force participation is determined by a complex interaction of often gendered economic, demographic, and cultural factors that vary considerably by ethnic group. This analysis employs probit regression techniques to census data to explore possible explanations for the observed changes. This paper focuses on five of China's larger ethnic groups: the Han, Hui, Korean, Uyghur, and Zhuang. Although many of the findings differ by ethnic group, for married women there is evidence of a return to more traditional expectations about gendered household roles that is consistent across groups. The research techniques also uncover evidence of discrimination against men of certain ethnic groups.

## Notes

### Data and methods

Data: census 1990, 2000

Samples include respondents aged 15 and above in urban areas and are stratified by regions (specific to the ethnic group under investigation).

- Hui: Ningxia, Gansu, Henan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, Hebei, and Shandong
- Koreans: Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang
- Uyghur: Xinjiang
- Zhuang: Guangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan

Urban areas

- The 5th and 6th digits of administrative location codes in 1990
- The 2000 census sample directly reports individuals as residing in city, town, or rural areas.

Probit regression

- Individuals have an unobserved reservation wage (the minimum wage at which they would enter the labor force) that follows a normal distribution. This underlying normal distribution of the reservation wage model aligns with probit regression's assumptions.

### Results

| Ethnic group | Women |  |  | Men |  |  |
|--------------|-------|--------|--------------|-------|--------|--------------|
|              | 1990  | 2000   | Change 1990-2000 | 1990  | 2000   | Change 1990-2000 |
| Total population | 68.91 | 57.71 | 11.20 | 81.92 | 74.00 | 7.92 |
| Han | 68.88 | 57.79 | 11.09 | 81.98 | 74.16 | 7.82 |
| Total ethnic minority population | 69.44 | 55.97 | 13.47 | 80.66 | 70.47 | 10.19 |
| Hui | 69.44 | 51.65 | 17.79 | 79.88 | 71.48 | 8.40 |
| Korean | 66.11 | 48.15 | 17.96 | 81.29 | 63.37 | 17.92 |
| Uygur | 60.64 | 50.73 | 9.91 | 80.99 | 60.82 | 20.17 |
| Zhuang | 78.25 | 65.45 | 12.80 | 83.34 | 77.67 | 5.67 |

Marriage

- For women, marriage increased the likelihood of participation by 9 percentage points in 1990 but decreased it by 1% in 2000.
- For men, marriage increased the likelihood of participation by 10 percentage points in 1990 and by 13.5 percentage points in 2000.

Ethnicity

- In 1990, the rates of the Zhuang, Korean, Uyghur, and Hui women's participation exceeded that of Han women by 10.6, 8.3, 3.4, and 3.0 percent, respectively.
- In 2000, Hui and Uygur women's participation rates had become lower than that of Han women by 5.5 and 7.3 percent, respectively. Korean women's rate became indistinguishable from that of Han women. Zhuang women's rate remained greater than that of Han women but the differential was reduced by half.
- These results were robust by region.

## Abstract

Marital health advantages and the increase of interracial marriage (intermarriage) are well documented, but few studies investigate the health of intermarried people. We address this issue using aggregated data from the 2000â€“2013 Current Population Survey (CPS) and find that people with racial/ethnic minority spouses report lower self-rated health than those married to whites. Spousal race significantly moderated the association between respondent's race and self-rated health such that minorities in same-race marriages had lower odds of reporting better health than those intermarried to whites. However, we found no differences in self-rated health among minorities intermarried to other minorities. There was also limited evidence that gender and socioeconomic status (SES) moderated the interaction between respondent's race and spousal race. Our findings highlight the effects of marriage on the self-rated health of respondents and their spouse as well as the importance of examining differences in couple's racial composition when investigating racial disparities in spousal health.

## Notes

Research questions

1. How does spousal race affect a person's self-rated health?
2. Is the association between race and self-rated health moderated by spousal race?
3. Is the interaction between race and spousal race in predicting self-rated health further moderated by respondent's gender and SES?

Data and methods

- The Current Population Survey (2000-2013)
- 528,776 respondents (75.60% non-Hispanic whites; 7.20% non-Hispanic blacks; 13.20% Hispanics; and 4.00% Asians)

Ordered logistic regression

- Model 1: self race
- Model 2: self race + spousal race
- Model 3: self race $\times$ spousal race

Results

- Minorities experience health disadvantage.
- Minorities interracially married to whites experience a spousal health advantage over minorities in same-race marriages.

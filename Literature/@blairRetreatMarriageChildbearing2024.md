## Abstract

The modernization of China has led to considerable economic and cultural change, and the rates of marriage and fertility have been declining. Despite recent changes in fertility policy, which allow for more births, the resulting pattern has been one of lower fertility. In addition, marriage rates have been declining, while cohabitation and singlehood have increased. Using a sample of young adults, this study examines the respective aspirations for marriage and childbearing of women and men in China. The results show that approximately 16% of females and 18% of males do not aspire to marry. In terms of childbearing, almost one‐third of females do not wish to have any births, while only one‐tenth of males feel likewise. Parental factors are shown to be substantially associated with males' marriage aspirations, while females' aspirations for both marriage and childbearing are strongly linked to their valuation of marriage and parenthood, themselves. The implications of the findings, along with the future of marriage and fertility patterns in China, are discussed within the second demographic transition paradigm ([[@lesthaegheSecondDemographicTransition2014]]; [[@zaidiSecondDemographicTransition2017]]).

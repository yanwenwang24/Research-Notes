## Abstract

The number of interracial relationships in the United States continues to increase. The fact is, though, that race remains a significant influence in the lives of individuals and in their relationships. Although there is evidence that relationships that cross racial/ethnic boundaries may be at greater risk for conflict and dissolution, there have been few investigations as to whether such relationships are at greater risk for violence. Using data from the National Violence Against Women Survey, I find that there are differences in risk of intimate violence depending on the racial/ethnic dyad of the couple. Ethnic monoracial relationships demonstrate the greatest risk for physical and nonphysical forms of violence, controlling for structural factors, whereas women in interracial relationships report higher rates of nonphysical violence, as compared with women in White monoracial relationships. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

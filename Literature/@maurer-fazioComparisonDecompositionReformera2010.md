## Abstract

**Purpose**
The purpose of the paper is to examine observed differences in China's ethnic majority and minority patterns of labor force participation and to decompose these differences into treatment and endowment effects.

**Design/methodology/approach**
Data from the three most recent population censuses of China are employed to explore differences in the labor force participation rates of a number of China's important ethnic groups. Gender‐separated urban labor force participation rates are estimated using logit regressions, controlling for educational attainment, marital status, pre‐school and school‐age children, household size, age, and measures of local economic conditions. The focus is on the experience of six minority groups (Hui, Koreans, Manchu, Mongolians, Uygurs, and Zhuang) in comparison to the majority Han. The technique developed by Borooah and Iyer is adopted to decompose the differences in labor force participation rates between pairs of ethnic groups into treatment and endowment effects.

**Findings**
Sizable differences are found between the labor force participation rates of prime‐age urban women of particular ethnic groups and the majority Han. Men's participation rates are very high (above 95 percent) and exhibit little difference between Han and ethnic minorities. For almost all pairwise comparisons between Han and ethnic women, it is found that differences in coefficients account for more than 100 percent of the Han‐ethnic difference in labor force participation. Differences in endowments often have substantial effects in reducing this positive Han margin in labor force participation. Roughly speaking, treatment of women's characteristics, whether in the market or socially, tend to increase the Han advantage in labor force participation. The levels of these characteristics on average tend to reduce this Han advantage.

**Research limitations/implications**
The paper analyses only one aspect of the economic status of China's ethnic minorities – labor force participation. It would be useful also to examine income, educational attainment, occupational attainment, and unemployment.

Model results

- Hui and Korean
	- In 1982 and 1990, Hui and Korean women had labor force participation rates that were indistinguishable from the Han.
	- By 2000, Hui and Korean women, respectively, were 3.5 and 5.5 percent less likely to participate in the labor force than Han women.
- Manchu, Mongolian, and Uyghur
	- In 1982 and 1990, Manchu, Mongolian, Uygur women were signiﬁcantly less likely to be in the labor force than Han women.
	- By 2000, the Manchu women became indistinguishable from Han in terms of labor force participation.
	- The very large gap between Uygur and Han participation in 1982 (21.4 percent) was reduced to 12.6 percent by 1990 and remained at 12 percent through 2000.
- The Zhuang are the only ethnic group with labor force participation rates substantially and significantly higher than that of the Han.

Because of endowment or treatment ([[@borooahDecompositionIntergroupDifferences2005]])?

- Endowment: education level, marital status, household composition, age structure, and location
- Treatment: coefficients of those attributes
- The coefficient effects clearly outweigh the attribute effects in all of our pair-wise comparisons.

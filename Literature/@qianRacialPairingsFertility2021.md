## Abstract

**Objective**: Our overall goal is largely descriptive—to compare recent fertility patterns between racially endogamous and exogamous couples in the United States. Evidence of lower fertility among exogamous or interracial couples arguably provides indirect evidence of social distance and cultural and economic integration.

**Background:** The growth of interracial marriage and cohabitation has fueled the rise in biracial or mixed-race children. Fertility rates are uneven among racial and ethnic groups, seemingly rooted in stigma and cultural differences (e.g., fertility norms). Whether fertility is different among interracial couples is unclear: Fertility rates that largely conform to the population of racially endogamous White couples provide evidence of social integration whereas differential fertility may reveal gender dynamics in fertility decision-making, including power relationships that depend on the race of male and female partners.

**Method:** We pool data from the 2008 to 2017 American Community Survey to compare past-year fertility patterns among endogamously and interracially married and cohabiting couples.

**Results:** Fertility is generally lower among racially exogamous than endogamous unions, especially among Asian American-White couples. Fertility among American Indian-White couples is much closer to patterns of White couples than of American Indian couples. Fertility among other interracial couples nevertheless varies by the race of male partners. That is, fertility of the Black male/White female and the Hispanic male/White female couples is similar to patterns found among endogamous Black and Hispanic couples, respectively. The White male/Black female and the White male/Hispanic female couples follow the fertility patterns of White couples.

**Conclusion:** In general, the fertility levels of interracial couples are intermediate between those of endogamous White couples and their endogamous Black, Hispanic, or American Indian counterparts, but vary significantly by the race-gender mix of partners.

## Notes

Research objectives

1. Compare recent fertility patterns between racially endogamous and exogamous couples in the United States.
2. Examine fertility differentials across couples representing different racial pairings.
3. Highlight how gender-racial partnering among interracial couples is associated with fertility patterns.

Racial differences in fertility

Fertility in racially endogamous and exogamous unions

- Interracial unions may have depressed fertility ([[@choiFertilityBehaviorInterracial2018]]).
- To compensate for disapproval, interracial couples make more educational investments in their biracial children. ([[@chengConstraintsResourceAllocation2007]]).

The racial mix of interracial couples and differential fertility

- According to assimilation theory ([[@albaRemakingAmericanMainstream2005]]), fertility among interracial couples should therefore be more similar to endogamous White couples than to their endogamous Hispanic, Black, American Indian, and Asian American counterparts.

Gender and fertility in interracial couples

- Does the fertility behavior of interracial couples fall midway between the average fertility levels of each race represented in the union, depending on gender?

**Hypotheses**

1. Fertility is lower among interracial couples than among their endogamous counterparts.
2. Fertility is lower among cohabiting than among married interracial couples.
3. Fertility rates among interracial couples vary by race and gender of partners.
	1. Fertility rates among non-White male/White female couples are, on average, more similar to those of the endogamous non-White couples than to those of endogamous White couples.
	2. However, fertility rates among White male/non-White female couples are more similar to rates among endogamous White couples than to those of endogamous American Indian, Asian American, Black, or Hispanic couples.

Descriptive statistics

- Nearly 15% of all couples are in interracial marriages, of which the overwhelming majority—nearly 90%—involve Whites.
- Gender asymmetries in interracial unions are especially large among Blacks and Asian Americans. Hispanic-White and American Indian-White pairings exhibit little gender asymmetry.
- The percent of interracial couples was lower among married than among cohabiting unions.

Logistic regression

- Dependent variable: Whether married and cohabiting couples had a child in the past year.
- Key independent variable: racial pairing (husband-wife)
- Covariates: age group, nativity pairing, educational pairing, union type, periods
- Level-2 covariates: percent of racial/ethnic minorities, percent of multiracial individuals, percent of foreign born, percent of those with completed college education, and median household income, all mean-centered and logged.

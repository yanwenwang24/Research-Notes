## Abstract

Human capital theory suggests that investment in education may generate marriage market returns. However, high expectations for potential marital partners by highly educated individuals, coupled with the huge cost of marriage driven by soaring housing prices in China, may discourage marriage intentions of highly educated people. Using the data from the China Family Panel Studies survey, we found that individuals with college education and above on average are less likely to get married than those who only finished high school or below. Our results are robust to potential functional misspecification and omitted variable bias. We also investigated possible explanations. Results indicate that, compared with individuals who have less than a college degree, those with at least a college degree are more likely to marry a person who has a college degree or above. In addition, an increase in housing prices exacerbates the negative impact of education on marriage.

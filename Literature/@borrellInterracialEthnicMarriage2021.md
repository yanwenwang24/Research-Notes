## Abstract

Race/ethnicity is associated with adverse birth outcomes in the United States. However, mostly mother's race/ethnicity has been considered. We examined the associations of mother's and parents' race/ethnicity with low birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm birth and infant mortality among New York City women between 2012 and 2017. We also examined the independent and joint effects of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition. We found that mother's and parents' race/ethnicity are associated with adverse birth outcomes; these associations are outcome-specific; and neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is not only associated with such outcomes but also modifies the association of mother's and parents' race/ethnicity with these outcomes. Our findings underscore the need to consider the race/ethnicity of women's partners and their neighborhoods calling attention to the role of context where individuals reside, and their daily interactions take place. These findings may have implications beyond New York City as our society becomes more racial/ethnic diverse and interracial/ethnic marriage becomes more common in the United States.

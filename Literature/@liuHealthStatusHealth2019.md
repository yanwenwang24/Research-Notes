## Abstract

Using Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) in 2005, 2008 and 2013, this study investigates health determinants and health inequality in China. The ordinal complementary logâ€“log model is used firstly to examine the impact of individual and contextual factors on self-rated health status. The study further checks the health inequality among subgroups divided by health determinants considered in the determinant model. We find that there are significant gender, residential, ethnic, socioeconomic, emotional, regional, and periodic differences. Moreover, the health status of sub-groups defined by factors used in this research is affected by health determinants in different ways which indicates the impact of these health determinants on health is moderated by each other. We conclude that while the health status generally varies with individual factors and social contexts, each group characterized by individual and contextual features has its own unique needs to improve and maintain their health status in China. The public policies aiming to increase Chinese health status and reduce health inequality must pay close attention to these needs while equalizing the availability, accessibility, and affordability of health facilities and health care system.

## Abstract

This study examines the conditions under which welfare state policies contribute to an equalization of the opportunity structure, focusing in particular on Scandinavia. Using data on intergenerational mobility and educational attainment, I find a clear equalizing effect in Scanidnavia that does not obtain elsewhere. The effect, however, is assymetric in the sense that it is almost exclusively a bottom-up equalization.

## Abstract

This study examines within- and cross-country trends and differences in marital sorting by education in Europe. Unlike previous research on assortative mating, our study focuses on the outcomes of the partner search process. We investigate how variations in (a) structural opportunities (educational composition of potential partners) and (b) assortative mating (non-random matching by education) have shaped trends and differences in educational sorting outcomes. Using vital statistics data on all marriages contracted from 2000 to 2020 in Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Italy, we decompose trends and differences in educational sorting outcomes into these two components. Within countries, trends in educational homogamy and hypogamy have been stable or increasing while hypergamy has declined. However, the drivers of these trends varied across countries. For example, in Sweden, shifts in assortative mating and structural opportunities led to more marriages between equally educated spouses, while in Italy, the rise in homogamy stems solely from changes in assortative mating. Within each year, homogamy and heterogamy levels varied between countries. Our findings demonstrate that these cross-country differences can be primarily attributed to variations in assortative mating rather than in opportunity structures. This study adds to recent research studying the structural causes of trends in sorting outcomes.

## Notes

Trends

- Increasing rates of homogamy ([[@katrnakChangePrevalencePreference2020]])
- Increasing hypogamy and decreasing hypergamy ([[@eratEducationalAssortativeMating2021]]; [[@esteveGenderGapReversalEducation2012]]; [[@esteveEndHypergamyGlobal2016]])
- Variations across countries ([[@domanskiEducationalHomogamy222007]])

Consequences of assortative mating

- Gender inequality, educational and earnings inequality between couples ([[@blossfeldWhoMarriesWhom2003]]; [[@breenEducationalAssortativeMating2011]]; [[@breenEducationalAssortativeMating2012]]; [[@schwartzReversalGenderGap2014]])

Less is known about why these outcomes have changed over time and differ across countries.

- The relationship between structural opportunities and educational sorting outcomes
- Disentangle the separate influence of changes in assortative mating and structural opportunities on trends in educational sorting outcomes

Research question

- To what extent can cross-national and cross-temporal variation in educational sorting outcomes of opposite-sex marriages be attributed to trends and differences in _structural opportunities_ and _assortative mating_?

Data and methods

- Data: All marriages (N=3,285,848) contracted in Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Italy in even years from 2000 to 2020, including first and higher-order marriages.
- A decomposition approach compares observed educational sorting outcomes with hypothetical outcomes that would have occurred if the assortative mating patterns or structural opportunities of another year or country had been in place ([[@leeschDecomposingTrendsEducational2023]]).

### Theoretical background

Partner search theory ([[@oppenheimerTheoryMarriageTiming1988]])

- Women's and men's preferences for candidates with specific traits
- The availability of preferred candidates on the partner market
- Partner search behavior

Structural Opportunities

- The relative size of a group in a population determines the probability of meeting members of this group ([[@blauInequalityHeterogeneityPrimitive1977]])
- Profound changes in the relative size of educational groups
- The speed to educational expansion differs across countries.

Assortative Mating

1. The rising popularity of online dating
	1. Opportunities for meeting candidates with different educational levels
	2. Reduce search costs and provide information about the available candidates on the partner market, contributing to rising homogamy rates
2. Rising gender equality has led to converging partner preferences ([[@mareFiveDecadesEducational1991]]).
	1. Women may choose partners based on desirable traits unrelated to economic success.
3. Economic inequalities between educational groups indicate how much someone lose when marrying "down" in education.
4. Welfare regimes ([[@esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990]])
	1. Socio-democratic states (Sweden)
	2. Mediterranean welfare state (Italy)
	3. Post-communist welfare (Czech Republic)

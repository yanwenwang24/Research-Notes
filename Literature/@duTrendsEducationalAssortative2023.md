## Abstract

This study, from an urban-rural integration perspective, examines and compares trends in educational assortative marriages by couple's rural/non-rural hukou status. We use new methods, such as rank-rank correlation and Exchange Index, to analyze 81756 couples from nationally representative survey data (i.e., the 2003-2018 CGSS and 2010 CFPS). We find a substantial and persistent difference between rural and urban marriages. Couples who both have an urban hukou have more similar educational statuses than couples of whom either one or both have a rural hukou. This gap in homogamous tendency is mainly driven by highly educated couples. Moreover, we find gender-asymmetrical hukou-status exchange patterns for rural-urban inter-marrying couples, whose relative advantages in hukou or educational status could not compensate each other. These new findings reveal the profound influence of unbalanced development between rural and urban regions, highlighting potential directions for future policies for better incorporating rural-urban integration with sustained population development.

## Notes

Four types of hukou matches

- Urban-urban
- Rural-rural
- Urban-rural
- Rural-urban

The focus on _current_ hukou

- A relatively stable social status over the life course
- Limited opportunities to upgrade one's _hukou_: marriage, higher education, and military service
- The possibilities of upgrading _hukou_ have been considered at the time of marriage

Status exchange between _hukou_ and education

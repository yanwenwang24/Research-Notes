## Abstract

Comments on [[@rosenfeldCritiqueExchangeTheory2005]]. The article of Rosenfeld is one of the more serious and well-thought-out attempts to criticize the hypothesis, both theoretically and empirically. Rosenfeld concludes that simple and complex approaches both refute status exchange. He further claims that homogamy rather than exchange is the most important educational mating pattern in mixed-race couples. Explaining this discrepancy is important since the article by Rosenfeld may have given readers the false impression that complex models and simple models should always lead to the same findings. Loglinear models have often been difficult to interpret for the less technically oriented reader, as Rosenfeld correctly observes, and their complexity may have alienated part of the audience that was originally interested in the topic of intermarriage. Rosenfeld argues that it is important to take account of differential educational homogamy depending on race. If this is what Rosenfeld means by saying that these couples are based on solidarity and affection, he is probably right. But this does not translate into equally strong or stronger levels of educational homogamyâ€”homogamy is weaker in these couples.
